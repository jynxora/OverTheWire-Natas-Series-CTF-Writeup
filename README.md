# Natas OverTheWire - Complete Walkthrough 

## About

This repository contains a complete walkthrough of 33 levels of the Natas OverTheWire wargame, one of the most popular web security challenges for learning server-side security concepts. Each level presents a unique vulnerability that must be exploited to retrieve the password for the next level. 

## What is Natas?

Natas is a wargame that teaches the basics of server-side web security. Unlike client-side challenges, Natas focuses on vulnerabilities that exist in server-side code and configurations.
Key Features:

- No SSH required—all challenges are web-based
- Progressive difficulty from basic to advanced
- Real-world vulnerability scenarios
- Safe, legal hacking environment 

### Starting Point:

- URL: http://natas0.natas.labs.overthewire.org
- Username: natas0
- Password: natas0
