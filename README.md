# OverTheWire Natas Progress  

This repository documents my progress through the **OverTheWire Natas series**, a set of web exploitation challenges focused on server-side security concepts.  

## About Natas  
- Natas teaches basics of server-side web security.  
- Each level reveals the password for the next (stored in `/etc/natas_webpass/`).  
- No SSH access — all interaction happens via the challenge websites.  

## Progress  
- Completed Levels: **0 → 11**  
- Current Level: **12 / 34**  
- Status: *Paused for now* (may return in chunks later)  

## Learnings So Far  
- Source code inspection  
- HTTP request/response manipulation  
- Cookie/session handling  
- Basic command injection patterns  

## Notes  
This repo is not a solutions dump. It only logs my personal journey and reflections during the **#700DaysOfSkill** challenge.  

## Next Steps  
- Shift focus toward **DFIR and Quantum Computing research work** (ongoing internship).  
- May revisit Natas later, but no strong promises — sustainable progress > forced grind.
